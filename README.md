# Homework 1: Code Refactor

## Description

This repository holds the first homework assignment for [The Coding Boot Camp](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/) through the University of Texas at Austin's Center for Professional Education.

This assignment is a project in code refactoring. In case this is new to you as it is to me, I looked up a definition of what code refactoring is and here is what I found from [refactoring.com](https://refactoring.com/#:~:text=Refactoring%20is%20a%20disciplined%20technique,of%20small%20behavior%20preserving%20transformations.);
> "Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior."
This simple definition is an exact representation of what this homework assignment is all about.

For this project we were given an existing html file, css file, and images and then tasked with refactoring the existing code. There were multiple steps involved in completing this project that included:

* Looking for the html elements and adjusting for semantics
* Making sure that the codebase follows a logical order
* Making sure that all images are coded properly for accesability
* Making sure that all headings follow a sequential order
* Making sure there is an accesable and descriptive title for the code

## Notes

In completing this project, here are some samples of the refactoring that I did.

* Corrected links within the header so the page would jump to the corresponding content section

* Added comments to each major section in the codebase

* Adjusted the values of the ID and class attributes to make them different which allowed for cleaner code in the stylesheet.

* Deleted IDs that weren't needed in the code

* Due to adjusting ID and class headings, css styling was able to be consolidated in the stylesheet.
